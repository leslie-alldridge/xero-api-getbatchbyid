# xero-api-getbatchbyid
The API previewer doesn't currently offer batch payments by ID - so I'm creating this application to help me find batches by their ID.

### Notes

App still needs better error handling and CSS styling. However, at this stage the main goal was to reveal batch payments (all) and single batches by ID. 

### Learnings

Good revision after a weekend of C#, Python and Docker. Learned not all API endpoints are available in Xero Node and how to handle those other endpoints. 

### Reflection
I think the main objective of this app is achieved. I'm probably the only person that will be using this as it's something that isn't ready for external users yet. I hope this helps us solve some tricky cases with batch payments - as cases like those are the reason I decided to code up a solution.
